# Ease-of-Use-Python-Scripts
A collection of my personal python scripts that make tedious tasks less... well... tedious. Below you will find a list of the checkers and their uses, along with any pre-reqs they may need to run properly.

Feel Free to use any of these for your day-to-day.. that's what they were made for. However I would like to get some credit if you use it in your own program or post it yourself somewhere i.e., a forum site, twitter, pastebin, idk wherever you end up posting it. I'm not putting this under an specific license but I am stating this here. GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE.

## DupeRemover
DupeRemover was my first python script I wrote all by myself :) It was made to take a combolist or any 1 column by infinite row list and remove any duplicated lines in that list. This was really made to tailor torwards email:pass lists so that you are able to cut the combolist down to just what is necessary. 

Not a ton of use but pretty proud of it :)

## (Upcoming) EmailSort
Yes I know this list is looking worse as you read it but EmailSort is just another test of python skills made to sort combolists by their @domain.TLD. Again, not much use but if you want to learn filtering, sorting, or anything to do with line modification in text files this will help in a way. :)

#More to Come..
